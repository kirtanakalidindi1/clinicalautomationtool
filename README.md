# clinicalautomationtool
An experimental RAG-based prototype that generates draft informed consent form (ICF) content from clinical trial protocols. Uses marker-based parsing, FAISS retrieval, and controlled LLM prompting to assemble clear, layperson-friendly ICF sections from long technical documents. All examples use synthetic, non-clinical data.
